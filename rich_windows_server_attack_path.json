The attacker can leverage CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep) for remote code execution via RDP, which is highly exposed. Additionally, the presence of CVE-2019-1234 (IIS Remote Code Execution) allows for further exploitation of the web server. The combination of these vulnerabilities presents a significant risk, especially given the critical CVSS scores of 9.8 and 8.8 respectively.",
