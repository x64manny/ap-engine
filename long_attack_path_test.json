The MySQL service is exposed on port 3306, which is commonly accessible. The initial access can be achieved through the Apache Tomcat service on port 8080, which is vulnerable to CVE-2021-4104 (CVSS 8.8), allowing remote code execution. This chain is realistic as both services are open and vulnerable, providing a clear path for exploitation.",
